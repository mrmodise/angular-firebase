# AngularFirebase

This project illustrates CRUD functions using Angular Firebase version 5.1.1. Angular Fire has received significant changes from version 4 to version 5. I hope this project saves you the time I had to spend understanding the differences in version 4 and 5. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Deploying to Firebase
App deployed to Firebase hosting and is available at https://angular-firebase-140c0.firebaseapp.com/company-list
